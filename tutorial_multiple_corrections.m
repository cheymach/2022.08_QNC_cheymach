%Exercise
%In this exercise we will run through an example of correcting for multiple comparisons with both the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure and the more conservative Bonferroni correction.

%First, simulate multiple (say, 1000) t-tests comparing two samples with equal means and standard deviations, and save the p-values. Obviously, at p<0.05 we expect that ~5% of the simulations to yield a "statistically significant" result (of rejecting the NULL hypothesis that the samples come from distributions with equal means).
%Second, once you have the simulated p-values, apply both methods to address the multiple comparisons problem.
%Third, set the sample 1 and sample 2 means to be 1 and 2 respectively, and re-run the exercise. What do you notice? What if you make the difference between means even greater?

%ANSWER: When I ran this assignment with all values the same except for both means
%were 1, no correction resulted in 60 significant values, bonferroni
%resulted in 0, and BH resulted in 57. I ran the code a few times and there
%was some variability with this count. 

%I re-ran the code with mean_s2 = 2, and with no corrections the p count
%was 1,000, BH was 992, and bonferroni was 964
